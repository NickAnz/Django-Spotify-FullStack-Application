# Django: Spotify FullStack Application
The basic premise of this project is to practice and use Django as a backend to handle requests from a frontend interface created in React JS. 
This will use the Spotify API to handle the currently playing song aswell as allow users to join the same room to vote to change the song playing at any given time. 
The application will provide details about the currently playing song aswell as the current time and artists.
